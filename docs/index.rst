Documentation for Raspberry Pi Camera Bot
=========================================

The Raspberry Pi Camera Bot project provides software that helps you to build a Raspberry Pi 
camera robot, that can be controlled by an easy to use web interface. The robot can be
driven around using a web browser on a smartphone, tablet or PC. Alternatively, the web based
interface can be accessed programmatically using a language such as Python. This means that 
autonomous behaviours can be created for the robot, and run either on a Pi, or on a more powerful
remote computer.

The Raspberry Pi Camera Bot project was created by `Dawn Robotics Ltd`_ to provide software for a
range of Raspberry Pi robot kits. However, it's also relatively easy to adapt the software for use
in your own robotic project.
